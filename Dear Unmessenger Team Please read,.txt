Dear Unmessenger Team,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to inform you about some challenges I have encountered while working on the assignment to fetch data from the IMDb site. Unfortunately, I am facing a 403 Forbidden error, which is preventing me from accessing the necessary data. This issue has impeded my ability to complete the assignment on time.

Additionally, I attempted to upload the environment folder to GitHub; however, I encountered another issue where GitHub does not support files or folders exceeding 25MB. This limitation has further complicated the process.

I hope you understand the difficulties I am facing. I would greatly appreciate your guidance and assistance in resolving these issues.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,
Adarsh Jaiswal.
